# Non merci !

This application is a non-configurable, very minimalist call blocker for numbers starting with one of the prefixes designated by ARCEP (the French telecom regulator) for use by call spammers. 

If you are outside of France or need more features, you should probably checkout [NoPhoneSpam](https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/NoPhoneSpam/).

The following hard-coded prefixes are blocked:

01 62
01 63
02 70
02 71
03 77
03 78
04 24
04 25
05 68
05 69
09 48
09 49
09 47 5
09 47 6
